The java source files in this directory are automatically
generated from mmparser.jj using javacc
(https://javacc.dev.java.net/)
** updated April 2020: javacc now at https://javacc.com/ , remarkably it still works!

Note that javacc will not insert package declarations
into the generated file; see the makefile for one
(rather ugly!) solution to this.

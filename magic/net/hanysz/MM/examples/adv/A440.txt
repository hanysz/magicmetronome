# Magic Metronome example script: A440
#
# Magic Metronome can go very fast!
# We know that the A above middle C usually has a frequency of about 440 cycles per second.
# What's that in cycles per minute?  440 times 60 makes 26400.
# So let's see what 26400 ticks per minute sounds like:

26400 R440(a)    # Play A440 for a second

# Actually, we didn't need to figure out 440 times 60.
# We could have asked Magic Metronome to do the arithmetic for us,
# like this:

440*60 R262(a)   # Play A440 for another second

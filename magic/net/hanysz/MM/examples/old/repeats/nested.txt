# You can put repeats inside other repeats.
# For example, suppose you want two bars of 3/4 time followed by one bar of 2/4,
# and you want to repeat that three-bar pattern five times.
# You can do it like this:

132 R5( R2(baa) ba)

# Just make sure that your parentheses balance:
# for every '(' you need a matching ')'.

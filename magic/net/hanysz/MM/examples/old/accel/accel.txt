# To speed up or slow down gradually, use an "accelerando block",
# introduced by a capital "A":

A(60 R15(baaa) 300)

# The letter "A" must be followed by a block enclosed in parentheses.
# You can give a starting tempo and a finishing tempo,
# but you can't change tempo in the middle.
# The next line would produce an error message, if you deleted the "#" at the start:
# A(60 aaaaa 80 aaaaa 100)

# Sometimes a piece of music slows down gracefully at the end of a section,
# then returns to the original tempo:

132 R4(baa)  A(R2(baa) 60)  132 R4(baa)

# Notice that the A() block doesn't have a starting tempo this time.
# Both the start and finish tempos are optional.
# If you leave out the start tempo, then it will start at whatever
# tempo was current before the beginning of the block.
# If you leave out the final tempo, then it will be very boring:
# the tempo just won't change!
# Try changing the tempos in this example and see what happens.

# Magic Metronome can go very fast!
# We know that middle C usually has a frequency of about 262 cycles per second.
# What's that in cycles per minute?  262 times 60 makes 15720.
# So let's see what 15720 ticks per minute sounds like:

15720 R262(a)    # Play middle C for a second

# Actually, we didn't need to figure out 262 times 60.
# We could have asked Magic Metronome to do the arithmetic for us,
# like this:

262*60 R262(a)   # Play middle C for another second

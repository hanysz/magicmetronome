# Tempo changes can be expressed relative to the previous tempo,
# instead of in beats per minute.
# Use the letter "T" followed by a number to produce a relative tempo change.
# This example starts off at 60 beats per minute,
# then changes to double speed (120 bpm), then three-quarter speed (90 bpm).

60 baaabaaa T2 baaabaaa T0.75 baaabaaa

# You can also use fractions, so the following line does the same thing.

60 baaabaaa T2 baaabaaa T3/4 baaabaaa

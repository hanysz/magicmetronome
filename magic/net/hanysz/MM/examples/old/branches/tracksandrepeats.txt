# If you start a new track inside a repeat, then you'll
# actually get a separate track created for each time
# through the repeat.  This can produce some strange effects:

R3(a a {14 dd} a)

# Notice that you can hear sound "d" six times, not just twice.
# (You have to wait a couple of seconds for the sixth one!)

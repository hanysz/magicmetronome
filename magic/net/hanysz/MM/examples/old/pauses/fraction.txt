# How do you pause for half a beat?
# Answer: double the tempo, then pause for a whole beat,
# then restore the original tempo.
# Remember that the letter T gives a relative tempo change.

# Here is four bars of 3/4, with half-beat rests after bars 2 and 3:
120 baa baa T2,T1/2 baa T2,T1/2 baa

30,  # wait two seconds before the next part

# For comparison, four bars of 3/4 with a whole beat rest after bars 2 and 3:
120 baa baa,baa,baa

30,  # wait two seconds before the next part

# Of course, you can make smaller fractions of a beat too:

120 baa R3( T4,T1/4 baa) # four bars of 3/4 with quarter-beat rests in between

# Can you hear the difference between half a beat and quarter of a beat?
# Try editing the script to play it at a slower tempo if you're not sure!

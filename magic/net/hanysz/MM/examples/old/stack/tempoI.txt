# The "tempo" stack can store a tempo and recall it later.
# Use "[" to push a tempo on to the stack, and "]" to recall it.

70 aaaa
[        # remember that the tempo was 70 beats per minute
140 aaaa   # go faster for a while
]aaaa          # go back to the first tempo

# Unlike other kinds of brackets, the "[" and "]" symbols don't need to balance.
# It's OK to store a tempo and never use it.
# If you try to recall a tempo that you haven't stored, then the tempo won't change.

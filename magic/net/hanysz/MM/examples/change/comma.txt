# Magic Metronome example script: Comma at phrase end
#
# This example is in 4/4 time with a comma (half a beat rest) at the end of every fourth bar.
# You can change the length of the comma by changing the number 2 after the "T" to a different number.
# Larger numbers will give shorter commas.  Decimals are allowed!
# To learn exactly what the square brackets "[" and "]" do,
# read the help page for "The tempo stack".

# Here's something you might hear in a performance of a Chopin waltz or similar:
# two short phrases and one long phrase,
# with each phrase speeding up in the middle and slowing down at the end.
# If you think the effect is too exaggerated (or not exaggerated enough!) then
# you can adjust it by changing some of the numbers.

Sorry, your script could not be played because it contains an error of some sort.

Future versions of Magic Metronome will aim to give more useful and informative 
error messages. For now, however, you'll just have to work out what's wrong 
with the script without any further help.  (Or of course it might not be the 
script at all, it might be a bug in the software.)  Thanks for your patience.

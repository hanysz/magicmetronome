<h2>Rest, pauses and silences</h2>
A comma in a script will give you a one beat rest.
If you want more than a beat, you have two choices.
You can use two or more commas in a row.
Alternatively, you can use the capital letter "S"
followed by the number of beats of silence you want.
<p>
If you want less than a full beat of silence,
then you'll have to change the tempo
(for example, half a beat of silence is the same as a whole beat
at twice the tempo).
<p>
Examples:
<p>
Three ticks, then a one beat rest, then three more ticks, then two beats rest,
then three more ticks looks like this:
<p>
<code>a a a , a a a ,, a a a</code>
<p>
Two ticks then a five beat pause then two more ticks looks like this:
<p>
<code>a a S5 a a</code>
<p>
Two ticks at 60 beats per minute then half a beat's rest then two more ticks looks like this:
<p>
<code>60 a a 120 , 60 a a</code>

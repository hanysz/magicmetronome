<h2>The tempo stack</h2>
Each track comes with a "tempo stack"
which can be used to store the current tempo
and recall it later.
Use "[" to store a tempo and "]" to recall it.
<p>
As a simple illustration, the tempo stack is a convenient way
to make triplets:
<p>
<code>a a [T3 aaa] a a</code>
<p>
In this example, the "[" will remember what the current tempo is,
then "T3" goes to triple tempo, "aaa" plays a triplet,
and "]" restores the original tempo.
<p>
It's called a "stack" because you can store lots of things on top of each other.
For example:
<p>
<code>60 a a [ 90 a a [ 200 a a ] b b ] c c</code>
<p>
The first "]" returns to a tempo of 90 beats per minute,
then the second returns to 60.
<p>
This can be useful for playing nested polyrhythms.
For example, here is a six beat bar
where the fourth beat is replaced by a septuplet
and then the third through fifth ticks of the septuplet
are replaced by two in the time of three:
<p>
<code>60 aaa [T7 aa [T2/3 aaaaa]aa] aa</code>
<p>
(By the way, unlike the "()" and "{}" symbols,
"[" and "]" do not need to balance.
It's OK to store a tempo without recalling it later.
And if you use too many "]"s, the extra ones will simply
be ignored.)

<h2>Repeats</h2>
You can make a repeated block by enclosing it in parentheses.
If you just put "(" at the beginning of something and ")"
at the end, then the block will be repeated forever
(or at least until you press the "Stop" button).
<p>
To repeat something a fixed number of times,
give a repeat count by using the capital letter "R"
followed by a whole number.
This must go immediately before the opening parenthesis.
For example:
<p>
<code>R4(a)</code>
<p>
will play sound "a" four times,
whereas
<p>
<code>(a)</code>
<p>
will repeat sound "a" forever.

(In an ideal world you'd be able to click on those examples to listen to them.
This isn't an ideal world.
But you can still copy the example text and paste it into the script window
if you want to play it.)
<p>
It's possible to use nested repeats:
you can put a repeated block inside another repeated block.
Just be careful that your parentheses balance:
every "(" must have a matching ")".

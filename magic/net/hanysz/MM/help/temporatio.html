<h2>Tempo ratios</h2>
Instead of giving the tempo in beats per minute,
you might sometimes want to describe a new tempo
relative to an old tempo.
This is done using the letter "T" followed by a number.
For example, to go twice as fast you can use:
<p>
<code>T2</code>
<p>
To go at half speed you can use either:
<p>
<code>T0.5</code>
<p>
or:
<p>
<code>T1/2</code>
<p>
(Numbers in Magic Metronome can be expressed as either decimals
or fractions.  Decimals must begin with a digit:
you should use 0.5 not .5.
You can also multiply numbers together using "*".
For example, "T2*3" will have the same effect at "T6".
(Actually, this only applies to tempos, not to numbers such 
as repeat counts.  This will be remedied in a future version.))
<p>
Relative tempos can be used anywhere an absolute tempo
(beats per minute) could be used.
For instance, our example from <a href="tempochange.html">a previous page</a>
could have been expressed as
<p>
<code> A(60 R5(b a a a) T2) </code>

<h2>Using multiple tracks</h2>
Magic Metronome can play several tracks simultaneously.
If you want all the tracks to start at the same time,
then you just enclose each track in braces&mdash;"{" and "}".
For example, here is the code to start two metronomes in two different tempos
at the same time:
<p>
<code>
{ 60 (a) } { 90 (b) }
</code>
<p>
If you want tracks to start at different times then you need to be
a little bit careful.
This next example will start a second metronome three beats after the first one:
<p>
<code>60 a a a {90(b)} (a)</code>
<p>
Notice that the "b" track is in the <em>middle</em> of the "a" track.
The rules for multiple tracks are:
<ul>
    <li>each "{" will launch a new track;</li>
    <li>every "{" must have a matching "}" some time later;</li>
    <li>the new track starts simultaneously with the tick that
    comes <em>after</em> its "}".</li>
</ul>
Like parentheses for repeats,
tracks can be nested: if you want to do something complicated,
you can have a new track starting inside another track.

<h2>Tempos, sounds and comments</h2>
The basic ingredients of a Magic Metronome script are sounds,
tempos and comments.
<p>
The lower case letters "a" through "d" will play the four built-in sounds.
(Yes, it really does have to be lower case.
Some capital letters have special meanings,
which you can learn about by reading the rest of the help pages.)
Letters "e" through "z" will at this stage play a beat of silence.
But be warned that this may change in future versions of Magic Metronome.
For better ways of including silences in your scripts,
read about <a href="pauses.html">pauses</a>.
<p>
Numbers set the tempo in beats per minute.
You don't have to use whole numbers;
decimals are also allowed.
<p>
The "#" character introduces a comment.
Anything following a "#" on the same line is ignored by Magic Metronome.
You can use comments to write memos to yourself
or explanatory notes for anyone else who might look at your scripts.
<p>
Spacing is optional.  You can put spaces between the different parts of your script,
or put things together without spaces,
according to what you think looks nice!
The resulting sound should be the same either way.
(There's one exception to this.  If for some reason you have two numbers in a row,
then you have to leave a space between the numbers.)
<p>
Try using the "Examples" menu to see how these basic ingredients
are used in scripts.
Feel free to edit the example scripts and see what effect your changes have.
Or you can delete everything in the script box and write your
own script from scratch.

<h2>Gradual tempo changes</h2>
To make a section of your script speed up, you need to use an
"accelerando block".  This consists of a capital letter "A"
followed by something in parentheses.  For example:
<p>
<code> A(60 R5(b a a a) 120) </code>
<p>
will give you you five bars of 4/4 time,
starting at 60 beats per minute
and gradually speeding up to 120 beats per minute.
<p>
Things to notice:
<ul>
    <li>the letter "A" goes <em>before</em> the opening parenthesis</li>
    <li>the starting tempo "60" goes <em>after</em> the opening parenthesis</li>
    <li>the final tempo "120" goes <em>before</em> the closing parenthesis</li>
    <li>the starting tempo is optional;
    if you leave it out, the block will start at the same tempo as
    whatever preceded it;</li>
    <li>the final tempo is optional, but if you leave it out
    (or accidentally put it <em>after</em> the closing parenthesis)
    then the tempo won't change at all;</li>
    <li>apart from the beginning and end, you're not allowed to use
    tempo changes during the accelerando block.</li>
</ul>

If you want something to slow down instead of speed up,
you still use an accelerando block;
you just make the final tempo slower than the starting tempo.
For example:
<p>
<code> A(120 R5(b a a a) 60) </code>
<p>
will give you you five bars of 4/4 time,
starting at 120 beats per minute
and gradually slowing down up to 60 beats per minute.

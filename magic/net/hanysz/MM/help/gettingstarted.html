<h2>Getting started</h2>
Magic Metronome will play a sequence of sounds according to a script.
Try loading a script from the "Examples" menu,
then press the "Play" button to see what it sounds like.
<p>
As well as doing the things you'd expect from a normal metronome,
Magic Metronome can also play scripts with changing time signatures,
rests and pauses,
sudden or gradual tempo changes,
and even polyphonic scripts with two or more tracks simultaneously.
<p>
You can edit the example scripts and customise them for your own uses,
or you can learn to write your own scripts from scratch.
<p>
You can learn about all the features of Magic Metronome
simply by looking at the example scripts,
or you can read the rest of the help pages
for a more systematic explanation.
<p>
As you read through the help pages,
you might like to copy and paste the examples
into the script window and play them.

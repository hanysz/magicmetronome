<h2>Changing the volume</h2>
The letter "V" followed by a number will change the volume of the following sound.
The number is a percentage, so "V200" will make something twice as loud
and "V50" will make it half as loud.
(There's no limit to how big a number you can choose,
but if it's too big then you'll get distortion.)
<p>
Example:
<p>
<code> a a a V200 a a a</code>
<p>
The fourth tick should sound louder than the others.
<p>
Note that a volume change only affects one tick.
If you want every tick to sound louder,
then instead of typing "V" over and over again
you might want to learn how to use <a href="macros.html">macros</a>.

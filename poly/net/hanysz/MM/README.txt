2nd April 2010: this is very much work in progress, and a few things need cleaning up.
A lot of code has been adapted from the not-yet-finished Magic Metronome project:
see http://hanysz.net/magicmetronome for details.

If you want to actually compile this thing yourself, you'll need to put it in
a directory tree net/hanysz/MM.  We all love the Java compiler, it does such a
thorough job of encouraging good organisation...

This version should work with java 1.5.

Eventually there might be a new and improved version of this software, with
options to save/load settings and to load sounds from .wav files.

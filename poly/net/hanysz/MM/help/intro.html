<h1>Welcome to Polymetronome!</h1>
Each track represents a separate metronome. You can operate them
independently, or you can start and stop them all simultaneously using
the "Start all" and "Stop all" buttons.
<br><br>

Use the "Add track" and "Remove track" buttons to create as many or as few tracks as you want.
<br><br>

For each track, type your desired tempo in beats per minute into the box
below the word "Tempo". Decimals are allowed (for example, you
might set one track to a tempo of 60 and another to 60.1 and listen to
what happens.) There's no theoretical limit to how big or small
the numbers can be, but you'll probably find that numbers over about
500000 don't work.
<br><br>

Click on the arrow next to the word "tick" to choose a sound for each track.
 There is a choice of four built in sounds.
<br><br>

Use the up-and-down sliders to adjust the volume.
 Press "Start" to start a track, and "Stop" to make it stop.

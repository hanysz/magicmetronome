v 0.01: 2006, December 23rd: one source file only;
	takes two command-line arguments (filename and tempo) and ticks.
	Weird bug: at tempo 120, get an extra part of a tick (but not at other tempi)

v 0.02: 2006, December 24th: two source files: Ticker and TickGUI
	very primitive GUI; in particular, it ignores all settings and just ticks at 120.

v 0.03: 2006, December 24th: three source files: add TickLooper
	now obeys settings: launches TickLooper as separate thread
	another bug: "overflow": runs on after stop button is pressed.
	no change in appearance of GUI

v 0.04:	2006, December 27th: four source files (also TickLooper, TickGUI,
				Ticker-- shouldn't be needed any more).
	implemented new buffering system:
	now possible to change settings while playing; overflow fixed
	classes: SoundCollection handles data, TickGenerator does synthesis,
	TickLooper is the thread that makes the sound, and MMgui is the GUI.
	seems tolerant of different buffer sizes (from 2 to 50000000);
	bug:
	    Error in class Soundcollection: addSoundToBuffer: too many
	    bytes--trying to read past end of sound.
	sometimes happens when changing sounds at extremely fast tempi (>1000bpm).

v 0.05: 2006, December 28th: same four source files, plus testing classes
		BufferTest, ByteIntConvert, EndianTest,
		plus Ticker: now obsolete
	added volume control, plus code to convert between samples and bytes;
	no known bugs at this stage;
	GUI is very ugly!

v 0.06: 2006, December 28th
	converted to "double metronome" with two channels;
	GUI slightly improved.

v 0.07: 2006, December 29th: new class SoundBuffer
	no change to functionality or GUI;
	reworked code to use SoundBuffer rather than handling bytes directly.

v 0.08: 2006, December 31st
	added "start/stop all", "add/remove track" buttons and scrollbar to GUI;
	changed implementations to use lists instead of arrays;
	implemented "greedy memory";
	changed file handling to use URLs not files;
	packaged everything as a JAR file;

v 0.09, 2007, January 2nd
	very minor changes: fixed loading of new sounds;
	temporarily removed error checking in openFile (is length correct?);
	made "addToPending" method in TickGenerator.
	Ready for first release!
	
v 0.10:	2007, January 27th
	lots of changes: I've been very slack about updating this changelog!
	moved all constant declarations to MMConstants.java
	made parser using javacc
	made data structures for event list
	reorganised project into packages; made makefile
	made new main class MM -- reads script or invokes gui as appropriate
	still need to implement many features of scripts...

v 0.11: 2007, January 28th
	implemented accel blocks and tempo stack;
	still to do: sound attributes, global settings,
	    markers,
	    macros and comments,
	    systematic set of examples,
	    documentation,
	    new gui
	bug: end sometimes gets truncated
	logic error in accel blocks? does accel start before or after first
	tick?

v 0.12: 2007, January 29th
	modified MM class to process command line arguments in a slightly
	better way (but still much room for improvement);
	implemented preprocessor
	(but need to address nested macro bug).

v 0.13: 2007, February 1st
	implemented volume (but not global track volume),
	starting from markers (but still need to do branches),
	checking for empty infinite loops.

2008, June 27th: need to fix two issues:
	first part of sound missing (flush buffer first?)
	when starting from marker, need option to play a countin

2008, August: hack: created MMfile.java to send output to a file

----

2010: decided to split project into Polymetronome (gui only) and
Magic Metronome (scripting)

PM 0.2: 2010, April 2nd
	wind back to 0.10 with some bits deleted, go to gui only version
	let's call this one 0.20

PM 0.3	2010, April 2nd
	use loadBuiltInSounds from previous "1.4"(?)
	make better volume icon
	write some help text
	To do: add load/save settings options; add load new sounds option

MM 0.2	2010, April 3rd
	first version of a GUI for scripts
	Lots of things to do:
	  write example scripts
	  organise submenu layout for examples
	  write help pages
	  implement open/save feature
	  implement undo for editing
	  implement user-defined sounds
	  implement sane error messages

MM 0.3	2010, April 4th
	implemented open/save/save as and submenus
	wrote some more example scripts and some help pages
	partially fixed parsing of arithmetic (we now have * and /
	    but not + and -; division by zero is ignored;
	    decimals are still accepted (and rounded) where integers are
	    expected).

MM 0.4	2010, April 5th
	finished example scripts and help pages
	sort of fixed bug where first sound doesn't always play
	problem: tempi accept arithmetic expressions but repeat counters don't
	problem: save button shouldn't need confirmation if you've previously
	    saved with that filename
	need to clean up error handling in MMPreProcessor.java !

PM	2010, April 10th
	renamed classes MM* to PM*
	(very minor change, so no version number)

	2010, April 11th
	changed both poly and magic to load sound names from file instead of hard-coded

MM 0.4.1	2010, April 11th
	fixed parsing of arithmetic expressions
	some slightly more helpful error messages
	modified ScriptPlayer.java to accept zero length accel blocks
	added flag to check if script uses macros (will be useful later!)

MM 0.5	2010, April 12th
	fixed ScriptPlayer.setFramePosition (was starting one tick too late)
	seems that playing ten empty buffers before starting is the thing to do
	implemented start from time and start from marker
	(need to write documentation that goes with those things)

MM 0.5.1	2011, December 28th
	haven't edited anything since approx April 2010, but made a spare copy
	just in case

MM 0.6	2012, January ??
	fixed some typos in help pages and example scripts
	fixed bug with pause/resume button labelling

work in progress: just started on the syntax checker

(BTW: to make source tarball: move MM to a different name then something like
tar -c -z -f polymetronome-0.3.0.tar.gz polymetronome-0.3.0/ )
